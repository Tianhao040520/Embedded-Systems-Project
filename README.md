## Project Overview
This project aims to design, implement, and evaluate an embedded system based on the ARM Mbed platform. The system demonstrates real-time data processing, peripheral interfacing, and embedded control principles using microcontroller-based hardware.

The development process includes:
- System architecture design  
- Embedded software implementation  
- Hardware testing and debugging  
- Integration and performance evaluation
