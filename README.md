## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an autonomous smart buggy capable of navigating its environment without human control. The system integrates hardware and software components developed on the ARM Mbed platform, applying principles of embedded control, real-time data acquisition, and sensor-based navigation.

The buggy is designed to detect and respond to its surroundings through onboard sensors, execute decision-making algorithms, and control its motion autonomously.
The project demonstrates a practical application of embedded systems in robotics, combining electronics, programming, and systems engineering.
